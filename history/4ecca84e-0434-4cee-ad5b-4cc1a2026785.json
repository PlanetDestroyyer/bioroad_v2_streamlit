        "advice": "Based on the information provided, here s some care advice for your 3-month-old banana plant in the vegetative stage, which is also known as the seedling stage: 1. Current Plant Health and Growth Stage: Your banana plant is in the seedling stage. At this stage, the plant should be between 2-12 inches (5-30 cm) tall. The presence of three healthy green leaves indicates good health. Focus should be on promoting strong root and pseudostem development. 2. Weather Conditions and Their Impact: Since weather data for Pune is unavailable, I will provide general recommendations. Ideal temperatures for this stage are between 26-30 C (79-86 F). Protect the plant from strong winds. 3. Disease Prevention Treatment Recommendations: Your plant has Banana Cordana. Apply a fungicide specifically labeled for Cordana leaf spot, following the manufacturer s instructions. Improve air circulation around the plant by pruning away any dead or dying leaves. Ensure proper spacing between plants if you have multiple banana plants. 4. Watering Schedule: Without weather data, a general watering guideline is to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Ensure the pot has good drainage to prevent root rot. 5. Frost Protection: Not enough information to determine if frost protection is needed. 6. Optimal Growing Conditions: Provide 12-14 hours of bright, indirect sunlight daily. Maintain a slightly acidic soil pH between 5.5-6.5. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer, high in potassium and nitrogen. 7. Immediate Actions Needed: Treat the Banana Cordana with an appropriate fungicide. Monitor the plant closely for any signs of stress or disease. Once weather data is available, adjust watering and protection strategies accordingly.",

        "advice": "Based on the information you provided, here s some advice for your 3-month-old banana plant in the vegetative stage: 1. Plant Health and Growth Stage: Your banana plant is in the seedling stage, characterized by rapid leaf production and root system expansion. The presence of three healthy green leaves indicates good health. 2. Weather Conditions: Since weather data for Pune, IN is unavailable, I will provide general recommendations. Banana plants thrive in warm, humid conditions. Protect the plant from strong winds. 3. Disease Prevention Treatment: You mentioned the plant has Banana Cordana. Apply a fungicide according to the product label. Ensure good air circulation around the plant to reduce humidity and prevent fungal diseases. 4. Watering Schedule: Without specific weather data, water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry. Ensure the pot has good drainage to prevent waterlogging. 5. Frost Protection: If temperatures drop below 15 C, provide frost protection. Move the plant indoors or cover it with a cloth. 6. Optimal Growing Conditions: Provide 10-12 hours of direct sunlight daily. Maintain a temperature between 26-28 C. Use a well-draining, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0-6.8. 7. Immediate Actions: Treat the Banana Cordana with an appropriate fungicide. Monitor the plant regularly for any signs of stress or disease. Once weather data is available, adjust watering and protection strategies accordingly.",
